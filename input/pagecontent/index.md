### Terminology

Where possible/practical UK SNOMED CT will be used (TODO ISN). The following principles will be followed:

- It is the responsibility of the sender or provider of information to perform any code conversions, not the recipient.

To aid with the use of UK SNOMED CT and other terminology, the [Terminology Server](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/terminology-server) is recommended

Alternatively, these services can be created locally. IHE recommendations for these interfaces are shown on the diagram above.
